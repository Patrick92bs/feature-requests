# Rocket.Chat Feature Requests

This repository is used to track [Rocket.Chat](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat) feature requests and discussions. Click [here](https://github.com/RocketChat/feature-requests/issues/new) to open a new feature request.

**Note:** Rocket.Chat bugs are tracked in the [Rocket.Chat repo issue tracker](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues).

## Suggesting Features

Many of the features in Rocket.Chat came from suggestions by you, the community! We welcome any ideas about how to make our product better for your use case. Unless there is overwhelming demand for a feature, it might not get implemented immediately, but please include as much information as possible that will help people have a discussion about your proposal:

1. **Use case:** What are you trying to accomplish, in specific terms? Often, there might already be a good way to do what you need and a new feature is unnecessary, but it’s hard to know without information about the specific use case.

2. **Could this be a plugin?** In many cases, a feature might be too niche to be included in the core of a library, and is better implemented as a companion package. If there isn’t a way to extend the library to do what you want, could we add additional plugin APIs? It’s important to make the case for why a feature should be part of the core functionality of the library.

3. **Is there a workaround?** Is this a more convenient way to do something that is already possible, or is there some blocker that makes a workaround unfeasible?

Please keep in mind that feature requests should be well specified and unambiguous, to have the greatest chance of being worked on by a contributor.

The [issues](https://github.com/RocketChat/feature-requests/issues/) area of this repo should be used to discuss new features and possible implementation designs. You can show your support for (or against!) features by using GitHub reactions, or by adding meaningful details which help the feature definition become more clear. Please do not comment with "+1" as it creates a lot of noise (e-mails, notifications, etc.).

Please refrain from submitting a pull request in the main [Rocket.Chat repo](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat), to implement a proposed feature, until there is consensus that it should be included. This way, you can avoid putting in work that can’t be merged in. Once there is a consensus on the need for a new feature, proceed as listed in the [Rocket.Chat CONTRIBUTING doc](https://rocket.chat/docs/contributing/).

## Feature Request Issue Triage

Work with the requester and others in the community to build a clear specification for the feature and update the issue description accordingly.

Core contributors may add the `help-wanted` label to feature requests. This indicates the feature is aligned with the project roadmap and a high-quality pull request will almost certainly be merged.
